# MarsMadness

MarsMadness was created to allow anyone to get an actual photo from the Mars rover on a date of their choice. The photo is selected randomly from all of the available photos from all of the available cameras on the rover that were taken on that day. This is accomplished using NASA's free Mars Rover Photos API. In addition to this you'll be given a fun fact about the planet. This provides a simple to use and fun way to learn about our neighbor planet - where we may be sending people in the near future!

In addition to the information about mars we wanted to see what other API's were out there that could provide information about other objects in our solar system that would allow us to line up the dates. We were able to find a free API that would give you an image of the moon's phase for that day. We chose to follow along with the theme and present the user.

## Project Description

When the user loads the page they are presented with a screen that has a date picker and a background image of the planet mars. The user can then pick a date from now all the way back to the date when we started recieving images from the mars rover, 08/2012. Once the user has selected their date they will then be presented with 6 images from one of the mars rovers that were taken on that day - This is accomplished using the mars rover API. With these images they will be given a fun fact about our neighboring planet.

They will also be presented with an image of what our moon looked like on that same day. We have added a fun fact about our moon to display with the image we pulled from our moon phase API.

## Features

- A date picker that the user can easily interact with and make a request for the chosen date.

## APIs

For our first API we used NASA's Mars rover image API to find out more about this API and many others that NASA has available please visit: https://api.nasa.gov/
or
the API's github page:

For our second API we used a free moon phase API. For more information on how to use and access this API visit: https://docs.astronomyapi.com/endpoints/studio/moon-phase
